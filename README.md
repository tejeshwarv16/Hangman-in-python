Here is a sample README for the Hangman game in Python:

# Hangman Game

This is a simple command line Hangman game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

The program will randomly select a word from a predefined list. 

The player has to guess letters one by one to reveal the secret word.

Players get a limited number of incorrect guesses (attempts) before they lose.

Guessing a letter that is not in the word reduces the number of attempts left. 

Repeating a letter that has already been guessed does not reduce attempts.

The game ends when the player guesses the full word before running out of attempts.

## Code Explanation

- `choose_word()` randomly picks a word from the word list
- `display_word()` shows the letters guessed correctly and underscores for others  
- `hangman()` contains the main game loop
  - Displays attempts remaining
  - Gets player's guess
  - Checks if letter is already guessed
  - Checks if guess is in the word and updates display
  - Reduces attempts on wrong guess
  - Checks if user won or lost

The code is structured to be modular with separate functions for distinct tasks.

Proper validation is done for input.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `random` module for choosing random word

## Future Improvements

- Add more words to choose from 
- Include hints for player
- Improve display with ASCII art
- Add difficulty levels
- Keep statistics of wins/losses

## Disclaimer

This game was built for educational purposes and represents a basic implementation. Significant effort may be required to turn it into a full-scale playable game. 

Suggestions for improvements are welcome!
